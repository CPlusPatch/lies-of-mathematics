# Introduction

Mathematics as we know it today is a product of great historical fraud. For millenia, we have been gaslit with false statements about the fundamental rules of artithmetics, geometry, and algebra.

Today, I intend to poke holes in the fabric of this great lie, and reveal the truth about the nature of mathematics.

# The Zero Proof

Let $a$ and $b$ be two real numbers such that $a = b$.

Then, we have:
$$a^2 = ab$$

Subtracting $b^2$ from both sides, we get:
$$a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2$$

Factoring both sides, we get:
$$(a + b)(a - b) = b(a - b)$$

We can simplify this to:
$$a + b = b$$

Since $a = b$, we can substitute $a$ for $b$ in the equation:
$$a + a = a$$

Simplifying, we get:
$$2a = a$$

Dividing both sides by $a$, we get:
$$2 = 1$$

This is a contradiction, and so we have proven that $a$ and $b$ cannot be equal.

However, we have not made any assumptions about $a$ and $b$, and so **we can conclude that no two real numbers can be equal.**

## Further Development

Instead of substituting $a$ for $b$ at step 5, we could have kept the equation like this:

$$a + b = b$$

Subtracting $b$ from both sides, we get:

$$a = 0$$

We have not made any assumptions about $a$ or $b$ apart from their status as real numbers, and so we can conclude that **all real numbers are equal to zero.**

# The Infinity Paradox

The concept of infinity is a great lie. It is a concept that has been used to deceive us into believing that there is no limit to the size of numbers.

However, I intend to prove that infinity is a paradox, and that it is a concept that cannot exist in the real world.

## The Proof

Let $a$ be a real number such that $a = \infty$.

Then, we have:

$$a = a + 1$$

Subtracting $a$ from both sides, we get:

$$0 = 1$$

This is a contradiction, and so we have proven that **infinity is a paradox.**

The explanation for things that may seem infinite is that they are actually finite, but very large. For example, the number of stars in the universe is very large, but it is not infinite.

# One By One Proof

In mathematics, we are told that $1*1=1$. However, I intend to prove that this is a lie.

Think about it. If we have one apple, and we add another apple, we have two apples. This is a fundamental truth that we all know.

However, if we multiply one apple by one apple, we get one apple. Where has the other apple gone? It has disappeared into thin air. According to the second law of thermodynamics, matter cannot be created or destroyed: it can only change form. So, the apple cannot have disappeared.

## Where has the apple gone?

The second apple has not disappeared. It has been hidden from us by the great lie of mathematics. If you look closely at the apple, you will see that it is actually two apples, but they are so close together that they appear to be one apple. This is the result of manipulation by the great mathematicians of the past, who have conspired to deceive us into believing that $1*1=1$.

# Conclusion

The world of mathematics is a world of lies. We have been deceived into believing that numbers can be equal, and that infinity is a real concept. However, with this simple paper, I have proven that these are all lies.

These are the first steps in a long journey to reveal the truth about mathematics. I hope that you will join me in this journey, and that we can together uncover the truth about the nature of numbers.
